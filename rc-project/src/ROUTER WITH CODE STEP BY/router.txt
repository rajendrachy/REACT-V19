Here's a clear comparison between Link and NavLink in React Router:
-> Link is used for basic navigation between routes without reloading the page. It does not apply active styles.
NavLink also navigates, but it adds styling or classes automatically when the link matches the current URLâ€”perfect 
for active menu highlights. Use Link for general links, and NavLink when you want to style the currently active
 route (like in a navbar).






 ðŸ§­ What is BrowserRouter in React?
BrowserRouter is a router component from the react-router-dom library that enables
navigation in a React application using the HTML5 history API.

 In Simple Terms:
It wraps your entire React app.
